# Brand Sustainability Data Fetcher
Given a list of brands, this code will use generative AI to create summaries of sustainability efforts based on brand self-report data available online. The bulk of the code is available in the "Brand_Sustainability_Data_Fetcher" Jupyter notebook. 

The best overview is in the public Google Colab Notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vHvDxtA7-8-_xl6AdCx9Hr0qZBFUWNib?usp=sharing). It discusses how the code works, what could be improved, and includes some summary information.

The best way to view the final output for all 1,000 brands is [this page](https://scisley.github.io/brand-sustainability-data-fetcher/).

You can download the raw results in the `brand_summary.csv` file in this repo.
