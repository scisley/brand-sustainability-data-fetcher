<p>Taco Bell has implemented several initiatives to protect the environment and reduce its carbon footprint. The company transitioned all of its cold beverage cups and lids in U.S. restaurants to recyclable polypropylene, eliminating polystyrene and reducing resin usage. This change is part of Taco Bell's broader commitment to reducing landfill waste and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, Taco Bell has joined the NextGen Cup Consortium to support the development of recyclable hot cups. In terms of sustainable sourcing, Taco Bell uses palm oil in its Cinnabon Delights® that is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), aiming to minimize the negative impact of palm oil production on the environment and communities. The company has also made strides in sustainable packaging, with paper bags made from 100% recyclable and sustainably sourced materials and a switch from polystyrene foam to polypropylene for side containers. Taco Bell has set goals for 2025 to make all customer-facing packaging recyclable, compostable, or reusable, remove PFAS, Phthalates, and BPA from all customer-facing packaging, and add recycling and/or composting bins to all restaurants where infrastructure permits.</p>
<p>In a significant move to improve the environmental effects of its supply chain, Taco Bell has partnered with Cargill and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) to implement conservation and regenerative agriculture practices across cattle grazing lands. This $2 million partnership aims to conserve natural resources and reduce the climate impact of beef, one of Taco Bell's top-selling ingredients. The partnership will support beef producers with technical and financial tools to expand regenerative ranching practices, expected to sequester up to 44,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2030.</p>

<p>Tide is actively engaged in several initiatives aimed at reducing environmental impact, particularly in the areas of energy and water conservation. The brand emphasizes the importance of washing laundry in cold water, highlighting that doing so can significantly reduce energy consumption. Tide's detergents are formulated to perform effectively in cold water, which not only conserves energy but can also lead to financial savings for consumers. By switching from hot to cold water for laundry, it's estimated that enough energy can be saved in a year to charge a smartphone for a lifetime, potentially saving more than $150 annually on energy bills. Additionally, Tide promotes the use of High Efficiency (HE) washing machines, which can use significantly less water than traditional models. The brand's detergents are concentrated, meaning they contain more cleaning ingredients and less water per dose compared to other brands, further contributing to water conservation. Tide also focuses on sustainable packaging, with bottles made from at least 25% post-consumer recycled plastic. Innovations like Tide HE Turbo Clean and Tide PODS® are designed to optimize water use in HE washers and require less water to manufacture, respectively, showcasing Tide's commitment to water-saving initiatives and product innovation.</p>

<p>Allstate is actively engaged in efforts to protect the environment and combat climate change. The company has committed to achieving net zero emissions for its business operations and value chain by 2030, a goal that significantly precedes the timeline set by the Paris climate accords. To support this commitment, Allstate has undertaken several initiatives, including increasing biodiversity through the protection and enhancement of native wildlife at a 1,600-acre almond orchard in California. This effort has led to the creation of an ecosystem that regulates water, absorbs carbon dioxide, and promotes biodiversity. Additionally, Allstate is reducing the emissions and square footage of its offices, investing in renewable energy, and partnering with suppliers to reduce their emissions. The company has also transitioned to a hybrid and remote workforce, which has resulted in a reduction of verified emissions by 45% between 2015 and 2021. Furthermore, Allstate's investments in sustainable agriculture and timberlands in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States contribute to increased biodiversity and carbon sequestration. These efforts are part of Allstate's holistic approach to carbon reduction and its commitment to making responsible choices to prepare for and mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>Cadillac is actively working towards a sustainable future through various environmental initiatives. A significant commitment is the transition to renewable energy, with a goal to source 100% renewable energy for U.S. operations by 2025 and for global operations by 2035. Notably, GM's Spring Hill Manufacturing, which produces Cadillac models, is expected to rely entirely on solar energy by the end of 2023. Similarly, GM’s Arlington Assembly has been powered by 100% renewable wind energy since late 2018. Additionally, the Lansing Grand River Assembly in Michigan will utilize solar energy generated with technology from First Solar, Inc., equivalent to the yearly electricity use of approximately 47,882 U.S. homes. Cadillac has also embraced a circular approach to sustainability, using over 11 million pounds of recycled PET plastic in vehicle components in 2022. Furthermore, the company is committed to battery recycling and reuse, collaborating with the Department of Energy’s U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium to advance lithium-ion battery recycling and reduce reliance on mining. These efforts are part of Cadillac's broader vision to transition to an all-electric lineup by the end of the decade, starting with the introduction of the fully electric LYRIQ crossover.</p>

<p>PlayStation, a brand under Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), has implemented several initiatives to reduce its environmental impact. These efforts are part of Sony Group's "Road to Zero" global environmental plan, aiming for a zero environmental footprint by 2050. PlayStation has committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2040. To reduce the power consumption of its consoles, PlayStation has incorporated energy-efficient technologies such as System-on-a-Chip (SoC), die shrink, power scaling, efficient power supplies, and energy-saving rest modes. The PlayStation 5 (PS5) includes new energy-efficient technology that is estimated to avoid approximately 45,600 tonnes of CO2 per year for every million consoles sold. This includes a new efficient USB charging mode and a 7 nm chipset. PlayStation has also made strides in reducing the carbon impact of its products and services by avoiding an estimated 19.5 million tonnes of carbon equivalent emissions globally since the launch of the PS4 in November 2013, with a goal of reaching 27 million by 2030. Additionally, PlayStation is a founding member of the Playing for the Planet Alliance (P4P), which focuses on addressing climate change, restoration of ecosystems, and plastics reduction. Through this alliance, PlayStation has committed to various initiatives, including the development of a carbon footprint tool for P4P members to estimate and manage their own life-cycle carbon emissions. PlayStation's packaging for the PS5 is between 93-99% plastic-free by weight, contributing to its efforts to reduce plastic use.</p>

<p>Buffalo Wild Wings, as part of Inspire Brands, is actively engaged in various environmental protection efforts focusing on energy and water usage reduction, waste management, and sustainable packaging. The company has made significant strides in reducing its environmental footprint through initiatives such as shifting to reusable dishware for dine-in, which eliminated 700 million pieces of single-use packaging annually. Additionally, Buffalo Wild Wings has focused on serving beverages from reusable steel kegs instead of single-use cans and bottles, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately six million kg of CO2e and preventing over 15 million pounds of single-use containers from entering landfills each year. The brand has also implemented an LED retrofit on kitchen lighting in all company-owned sports bars, saving more than 5.2 million kilowatt hours of energy and $520,000 annually. Furthermore, an energy management system initiative is expected to result in a 5% average reduction in gas and electric use year-over-year. These efforts are part of a broader commitment by Inspire Brands to enhance environmental stewardship across its restaurant portfolio.</p>

<p>Hamburger Helper has taken a significant step towards environmental sustainability by modifying the packaging of its product. By slightly straightening the noodles within their boxes, Hamburger Helper has been able to lay the product flatter, reducing the amount of air in each box. This adjustment has led to a reduction in the size of the boxes, saving nearly 900,000 pounds of paper fiber annually. This change not only results in a decrease in the use of packaging materials but also contributes to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 11 percent. This is equivalent to removing 500 trucks from the road. Additionally, the more compact packaging allows for a 20 percent increase in the number of products that can be stocked on shelves, enhancing efficiency and reducing waste throughout the supply chain. These efforts demonstrate Hamburger Helper's commitment to driving innovation in packaging and reducing environmental impact.</p>

<p>Air Wick has taken significant steps towards sustainability, particularly with its Botanica by Air Wick range. This range is a testament to their commitment to reducing their environmental footprint through the use of more natural, responsibly sourced ingredients and sustainable packaging. Air Wick collaborates with fragrance house suppliers to responsibly source natural fragrances, ensuring that all suppliers conform to RB's ingredients policy. This policy includes stipulations against the use of dyes, animal testing on final products, and mandates responsibly sourced natural ingredients. Additionally, Air Wick supports sustainable farming practices globally, which benefits both nature and the farming community.</p>
<p>The company has also focused on the recyclability of its products. Air Wick has redesigned its packaging with sustainability and recyclability in mind, ensuring that all products are recyclable.

For example, electrical components are directed to Waste and Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) recycling centers, while glass products can be recycled through regular glass recycling channels.</p>
<p>Moreover, Air Wick has committed to using recycled materials in its products. The Botanica range features packaging with significant percentages of post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials, such as 65% PCR in cardboard boxes and up to 99% PCR in PET bottles. The company has also reduced the amount of plastic used in packaging and increased the use of PCR materials, adhering to safety and quality requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to these efforts, Air Wick's cardboard packaging and reeds are Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified, ensuring they meet the highest environmental and social standards and are sourced from well-managed forests. The Botanica candles are made with Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Certified palm wax, replacing traditional paraffin wax content and supporting sustainable palm oil production. Lastly, Air Wick has introduced plant-based solvents in its products to reduce the use of traditional solvents, furthering its commitment to environmental protection.</p>

<p>Corona Light, as part of its sustainability efforts, has taken significant steps towards reducing its environmental impact, particularly in terms of plastic usage. The brand has achieved a net-zero plastic footprint, meaning it recovers and recycles as much or more plastic than it uses globally. This initiative prevents plastic from polluting natural paradises. To accomplish this, Corona has partnered with South Pole, a climate solutions provider, to measure the plastic used in its products and distribution and to calculate the impact of its mitigation activities. One of these activities includes a major investment in Mexico Recicla, a recycling facility in Mexico, allowing Corona to recover more plastic than it uses. Additionally, the brand has removed plastic rings from all of its exported cans and eliminated plastic from its pressure-sensitive labels, reducing its footprint by 50,000 pounds. Since 2017, in collaboration with Corona X Parley, the brand has cleaned up 44,026,625 square meters of beach. Corona also invests in recycling programs in Mexico to recover and recycle plastic before it reaches oceans and waterways. Furthermore, the brand has launched the Plastic Free Challenge, an accelerator program aimed at finding solutions for pressing environmental and social challenges.</p>

<p>The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) has taken significant steps towards environmental protection through the launch of its Environment Strategy in 2021, aiming to become a 'green nutrition NGO'. This strategy is a comprehensive approach to reducing the environmental impact of GAIN's programs while advocating for a transformation of the food system to benefit both people and the planet. Recognizing the intrinsic link between food systems and environmental impacts, GAIN is addressing these issues across its programs, partnerships, and advocacy work. Efforts include rolling out Environmental Guidelines for project managers to assess and mitigate the environmental impact of programs, developing partnerships with environmentally focused organizations like the World Wild Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Food and Land Use Coalition (FOLU), and increasing the environmental sustainability of GAIN's own offices. These initiatives aim to find solutions that benefit both human nutrition and the environment, highlighting GAIN's commitment to addressing the interconnected challenges of climate change and nutrition.</p>

<p>Nintendo of America has taken significant steps towards environmental protection through its sustainability efforts. In 2020, the company established the Sustainability Committee, which is composed of members from various departments. This committee's primary goal is to explore new ways to advance Nintendo's sustainability efforts. One of the major achievements of this committee has been the reduction of CO2 emissions from operations. Since its establishment, Nintendo of America has transitioned to using 100-percent renewable energy for its offices and suburban shipping facility. Additionally, the company participates in a carbon-balance program, which contributes to local reforestation projects. These projects aim to offset CO2 emissions generated by natural gas usage in areas such as the company's cafeterias.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Nintendo of America has implemented a post-sales recycling program, known as the Take Back Program, which is available to consumers in the U.S. and Canada. This program allows consumers to recycle any of their electronics, not just Nintendo products. Nintendo provides postage and instructions for sending video game products to them for R2-certified recycling. The company also offers fully recyclable packaging upon request. In 2022, this program successfully received over 3,800 items for recycling, preventing more than 1 metric ton of materials from ending up in landfills.</p>

<p>Trader Joe's has made significant strides in environmental protection, focusing on resource management, waste diversion, and packaging improvements. The company has successfully composted and recycled over 670 million pounds of materials, including organic material, cardboard, plastic wrap, plastic buckets, and damaged pallets. Remarkably, approximately 99.5% of all Trader Joe’s products were either sold to customers, donated to food recovery partners, or composted, with only 0.5% not being diverted. This is a notable achievement compared to the USDA report that 10% of food in America is lost at the retail level. Trader Joe's is committed to further reducing this percentage and eliminating food waste from their stores.</p>
<p>In 2020, Trader Joe's made significant improvements to the packaging of over 150 products by eliminating excess components, increasing the use of recycled and sustainably sourced materials, and removing non-sustainable materials. Notably, the company removed over 2 million pounds of plastic packaging from its products. Examples of these improvements include replacing the black plastic tray for deli meats with a paper-based tray, switching from plastic clamshells to cardboard boxes for cherry tomatoes, and replacing multi-layer foil envelopes with home compostable clear film for tea packaging. Trader Joe's employs a five-point sustainability framework to guide these improvements, focusing on reducing and removing packaging, sourcing renewable and recycled materials, choosing recyclable packaging, avoiding harmful substances, and educating customers on proper disposal and recycling practices.</p>

<p>Planters, under its parent company Hormel Foods, has taken significant steps towards sustainability, particularly in its packaging. The brand introduced a new peanut-shaped packaging for its dry-roasted peanuts, which uses 8% less plastic than the previous standard 16-ounce bottles. This initiative is expected to save over 200 tons of plastic annually. This effort is part of Hormel Foods' broader "20 By 30 Challenge," aimed at reducing the negative environmental impacts of its brands' packaging, nonrenewable energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, water use, and solid waste. In the previous year, Hormel Foods' sustainability initiatives in packaging alone saved more than 727,000 pounds of waste. Additionally, Planters has collaborated with Applegate Naturals to launch the Do Good Dog hot dog, made with beef raised on verified regenerative U.S. grasslands, which supports reversing the impact of meat production on the climate by rebuilding soil biodiversity and organic matter.</p>

<p>Cadbury is actively working towards reducing its environmental impact through various sustainability initiatives. A significant focus has been placed on sustainable packaging as part of Mondelēz's 'Pack Light and Pack Right’ strategy. In March 2021, Cadbury removed plastic windows from all its chocolate shell eggs and transitioned to 100% sustainably sourced cardboard, eliminating 108 tonnes of cardboard from the market. Additionally, the company reduced the amount of plastic used in its large sharing bags by 15% and introduced packaging with 30% recycled plastic for two of its sharing bar brands, impacting over 28 million sharing bars. In Australia and New Zealand, Cadbury has made substantial changes to its Easter packaging, moving Cadbury Hollow Hunting Egg plastic crates to cardboard cartons and redesigning Easter Gift Boxes to save over 331,000 kg of plastic and cardboard packaging. These efforts are part of Cadbury's commitment to zero net waste packaging and making its packaging better for people and the planet through less packaging, better packaging materials, and investments in improved recycling systems. </p>

<p>Dial has implemented several initiatives aimed at protecting the environment and promoting sustainability. Through its partnership with Plastic Bank, Dial is actively involved in preventing plastic waste from entering the oceans. This collaboration enables the collection of plastic waste, which is then transformed into Social Plastic® and used in Dial's refill bottles. Dial's commitment to this cause is projected to prevent over 35 million plastic bottles from entering the ocean in 2023 alone. Additionally, the use of 100% Social Plastic® for Dial Hand Soap refill bottles (excluding the cap) is expected to save over 6.5 million pounds of carbon emissions in 2023 by utilizing post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. This effort not only reduces carbon emissions but also promotes the circular economy by reintegrating recycled materials back into the product lifecycle.</p>
<p>Dial has also launched a partnership with TerraCycle to address the recycling of packaging components that are not accepted through traditional curbside recycling programs. This initiative encourages consumers to participate in recycling efforts, further contributing to Dial's environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, Dial's introduction of Concentrated Refills represents an innovative approach to reducing single-use plastic waste. These refills use 95% less plastic compared to traditional soap bottles and are packaged in 100% paper-based materials, with the packets being recyclable through TerraCycle. This initiative is part of Dial's broader commitment to sustainability and reducing its environmental footprint.</p>

<p>Coors, under its parent company Molson Coors, has made significant strides in environmental sustainability, focusing on packaging, water usage, and climate change. The company has committed to ensuring that by 2025, all consumer-facing packaging will be 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable, with all plastic packaging comprising at least 30% recycled content. A notable initiative is the replacement of plastic rings with 100% recyclable six-pack packaging across Molson Coors’ North American brands, positioning Coors Light as the largest beer brand in North America to undertake such an initiative. This move is expected to eliminate 1.7 million pounds of plastic from the environment annually, with 400,000 pounds from Coors Light packaging alone.</p>
<p>In terms of water conservation, Coors aims to grow barley with 10% less water and brew beer with 22% less water by 2025 compared to 2016 levels. Additionally, the company is working to boost water availability in stressed watersheds and restore 3.5 billion gallons of water. Coors has also set ambitious goals to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% in direct operations and 20% across its value chain by 2025, relative to 2016 levels.</p>
<p>The company has demonstrated a long-standing commitment to sustainability, highlighted by the introduction of the recyclable aluminum can in 1959 and the nationwide recycling program, Cash for Cans, in the early 1970s. Coors has achieved zero waste to landfill status in all its major Coors Light breweries, with over 99.5% of waste being reused, recycled, or turned into energy. Since 2016, Coors has reduced its carbon footprint in the US by nearly 30%, saving more than 1.6 million metric tons of CO2e, and conserved 1.3 billion gallons of water.</p>

<p>Claritin has initiated the DiversiTree Project in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation, focusing on planting female trees to help reduce pollen levels in the environment. This effort is based on the understanding that female trees do not produce pollen and can help balance the pollen levels by receiving pollen released by male trees. The project began with the establishment of the first female forest in Forest Hill Park, Richmond, Virginia, one of the cities worst affected by allergies in 2022. The initiative aims to restore botanical balance by reducing pollen levels through the strategic planting of female trees, such as Juniper, Red Maple, Aspen, and Gingko. This environmental effort not only addresses the issue of rising pollen levels, which are expected to double by 2040, but also contributes to the broader goal of creating healthier outdoor spaces for the community.</p>

<p>The "Conscious Formula" initiative aims to make Maybelline's products less impactful on the planet. By 2030, 95% of Maybelline's ingredients will be bio-based, derived from abundant minerals, or produced through circular processes. As of 2022, 32% of ingredients meet these criteria.</p>
<p>Maybelline is also addressing the challenge of cosmetic waste through its "Conscious Disposal" efforts. The company is investing in the development of makeup recycling technologies and expanding takeback programs globally. In 2022, they collected 50 tons of empty product across seven countries.</p>
<p>Additionally, Maybelline has partnered with The Recycling Partnership to launch the Small Town Access Fund, aiming to improve recycling access for communities with populations under 50,000. This initiative is expected to impact over 49 thousand households by reducing contamination in recycling bins and capturing more than 3,500 tons of recyclables.</p>

<p>Jiffy Lube is actively involved in environmental protection through its vehicle maintenance services and oil recycling programs. The company emphasizes the importance of vehicle maintenance in reducing environmental impact. Properly maintained vehicles, including clean filters and lubricants, properly inflated tires, and correct engine tuning, contribute to better fuel efficiency and lower emissions. Jiffy Lube offers services such as setting the right tire pressures, servicing and replacing air and oil filters, and ensuring the engine and drivetrain components are well-lubricated to minimize fuel-robbing friction. Additionally, Jiffy Lube plays a significant role in oil recycling. Some Jiffy Lube locations serve as designated oil recycling collection centers, collecting used motor oil from changes performed at their locations and from individuals who change their oil themselves. This used oil is then sent to an oil-recycling center where it is re-refined and used to make heating oil, asphalt, and other petroleum-based products, significantly reducing waste and environmental impact. The company highlights the importance of recycling motor oil, noting that improper disposal of motor oil can release a substantial amount of oil into the environment, whereas recycling just two gallons of used oil can generate enough electricity to run the average household for almost 24 hours.</p>

<p>Greyhound has implemented several measures to reduce its environmental impact and promote sustainable travel. The company highlights that traveling by bus has the lowest carbon footprint compared to other modes of transport, excluding walking and biking. Specifically, choosing Greyhound over personal vehicles can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 79%, and opting for bus travel instead of flying can cut emissions by 84%. Greyhound's fleet includes modern vehicles designed with emissions-reducing components. These buses meet the latest EPA standards for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions and utilize clean-burning low-sulfur, Bio, or Renewable diesel fuel. Since 2008, all buses have been equipped with diesel particulate filters, and since 2014, new buses feature DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) after-treatment systems to further reduce emissions. Additionally, Greyhound has implemented idle management systems to conserve fuel and minimize emissions when buses are not moving. The company also focuses on eco-friendly practices in its stations, such as switching to LED lighting, employing environmentally-friendly landscaping that requires minimal watering, and recycling cooking oil used in food services. These efforts collectively contribute to Greyhound's commitment to environmental protection and sustainable travel.</p>

<p>Splenda has initiated a significant step towards environmental sustainability with the establishment of the first-ever fully integrated, United States-based stevia farm in Central Florida. This initiative is aimed at producing superior tasting stevia sweetener while fostering the growth of an emerging US agriculture industry. A key aspect of this endeavor is the reduction of environmental impact, particularly by eliminating unnecessary CO2 emissions that are typically associated with the global stevia supply chain. The farm's design and operations emphasize eco-conscious practices, including socially responsible farming techniques, water conservation measures, and effective waste management. These efforts are geared towards minimizing the environmental footprint of stevia processing. Additionally, the farm's vertical integration allows for comprehensive oversight of stevia production, from crop propagation to extraction, ensuring sustainability throughout the process. The innovative approach to stevia cultivation and processing not only aims to provide high-quality, great-tasting low-calorie sweeteners but also promotes a circle of sustainability by repurposing the clean stevia leaves as nutrient-rich feed in animal agriculture, thereby avoiding waste creation. This initiative reflects Splenda's commitment to environmental stewardship and its goal to contribute to a more sustainable agriculture industry in the US. </p>

<p>Corona Extra has taken significant steps to reduce its environmental impact, particularly in terms of plastic usage and carbon emissions. The brand has achieved a net-zero plastic footprint, meaning it recovers and recycles as much or more plastic than it uses globally. This effort includes major investments in recycling facilities like Mexico Recicla. Additionally, Corona has removed plastic rings from all its exported cans and eliminated plastic from its pressure-sensitive labels, reducing its footprint by 50,000 pounds. The brand also actively participates in cleaning up beaches, having cleaned up 44,026,625 square meters of beach since 2017 through the Corona x Parley initiative. In Canada, Corona has replaced all plastic packaging on its cans with cardboard packaging and introduced cans made from low-carbon aluminum, leveraging ELYSIS™ technology. This reduces carbon emissions by more than 30% compared to traditional manufacturing techniques. The brand also uses START technology to ensure transparency, traceability, and provenance across the aluminum value chain.</p>

<p>Virgin Mobile Middle East and Africa (MEA) has taken significant steps towards environmental protection by achieving net-zero carbon emissions across all its operations in 2021. This milestone was reached through a partnership with the Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence, which involved gathering and assessing data to calculate the group-wide total emissions and implementing sustainable processes for the reduction of overall emissions. Virgin Mobile MEA has eliminated over 50 tonnes of single-use plastic by removing it from its SIM packs and recharge cards. Additionally, the company has reduced the size of its SIM cards and switched to recycled paper for SIM card packaging, achieving 100% single-use plastic-free operations in Oman and Saudi Arabia. Sustainable practices have also been introduced in its offices, focusing on business travel, reduce and reuse policies, energy efficiency, and sustainability awareness and education. To offset its emissions annually and reach net-zero carbon emissions, Virgin Mobile MEA has invested in nature-based solutions. The company plans to plant thousands of trees in school locations through Carbon Footprint Ltd to support local wildlife habitats and educate children on the importance of natural ecosystems. Furthermore, Virgin Mobile MEA enables customers to offset their carbon footprint with any purchases made through the Virgin Mobile app, as part of its mission to achieve a carbon-negative footprint.</p>

<p>Miracle-Gro is actively engaged in several environmental protection initiatives, focusing on sustainability in product development and operations. The company uses over 3 billion pounds of green waste annually in its products, transforming yard clippings and tree branches into beneficial gardening materials. This effort not only recycles organic waste but also contributes to the production of environmentally friendly gardening products. Additionally, Miracle-Gro is committed to reducing its environmental footprint through sustainable packaging practices. The company's natural, dye-free mulch bags include post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials, sourced from items consumers recycle every day, demonstrating a commitment to minimizing waste and promoting recycling.</p>
<p>Miracle-Gro also emphasizes the importance of sourcing materials sustainably. By procuring materials close to its manufacturing facilities, the company aims to limit the transportation of heavy input materials, thereby reducing carbon emissions associated with logistics. Furthermore, Miracle-Gro offers peat-free options, such as the Miracle-Gro Organic Raised Bed &amp; Garden Soil, which utilizes wood fiber and compost. This initiative not only provides a sustainable alternative to peat, which is a non-renewable resource, but also enhances soil aeration and drainage for better plant growth.</p>
<p>In terms of local production, Miracle-Gro ensures that its soils and mulches are generally manufactured within 150 miles on average from the stores where they are sold, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. This practice supports local economies and reduces the carbon footprint associated with long-distance transportation of products.</p>

<p>Grupo Modelo is actively working towards environmental sustainability through its "Every Bottle Counts" initiative, aiming for all its beer bottles to be returnable or made primarily from recycled materials by 2025. This initiative has already seen significant success, with 478 million bottles recovered, preventing the release of 110,177 tons of CO2 emissions. This effort aligns with the company's broader sustainability strategy, which includes objectives for smart agriculture, water management, climate action, and circular packaging. The company's commitment to circular packaging is evident in its current operations, where 34% of its glass containers are made from recycled materials, and 51% of its glass bottles sold are reusable. Despite the strong returnable system, Grupo Modelo acknowledges the loss of some bottles to waste and has launched programs to recover these bottles, enhancing the circular packaging value chain and contributing to environmental sustainability. The company's sustainability goals for 2025 are based on science, with clear measurement methods aimed at having a global, environmental, social, and transformative impact across its entire value chain.</p>

<p>KIND has launched several initiatives aimed at environmental protection, focusing on sustainable agriculture and reducing its environmental footprint. The company has committed to exclusively sourcing its almonds from bee-friendly farms by 2025, aiming to protect pollinators by increasing habitat and eliminating harmful pesticides. This commitment involves expecting almond suppliers to reserve 3-5% of their farmland for dedicated pollinator habitat and eliminating the use of neonicotinoids and chlorpyrifos. Additionally, KIND has embarked on the KIND Almond Acres Initiative, a three-year pilot project testing regenerative agriculture practices on 500 acres in California. This initiative aims to source 100% of KIND's almonds from farms leveraging regenerative agriculture practices on a mass balance basis by 2030. The practices being tested include whole orchard recycling, cover crops, compost and biochar, off-ground harvesting, low carbon fertilizer, and subsurface irrigation. KIND has also signed the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, aspiring to reach 100% recyclability, compostability, or reusability across all its plastic packaging by 2025 while reducing its use of single-use plastic. Furthermore, KIND has committed to purchasing enough renewable energy credits to cover its US offices and manufacturing sites and will begin integrating renewable energy sources into its direct operations starting in 2021.</p>

<p>TRESemmé is actively working to address the environmental challenges posed by plastic waste, particularly focusing on the sustainability of its packaging. The brand has acknowledged the issue with plastic pollution and is taking responsibility for its plastic usage. TRESemmé has set ambitious goals to reduce the amount of virgin plastic in its packaging by 50% by 2025 and aims to help collect and process more plastic packaging than it sells. In Australia and New Zealand, TRESemmé shampoo and conditioner bottles are now made with 50% post-consumer Australian recycled plastic. Additionally, the brand has developed a pioneering innovation that allows its bottles to be made from detectable pigment, making black plastic recyclable. This innovation addresses the challenge of recycling black plastic, which has traditionally been difficult to sort at recycling facilities. TRESemmé's efforts contribute to reducing landfill waste and promoting a circular economy where materials are reused, recycled, or composted. The brand's commitment to using more post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials aligns with its goal to include at least 25% recycled content in its plastic packaging by 2025. These initiatives demonstrate TRESemmé's dedication to minimizing its environmental footprint and supporting sustainable practices.</p>

<p>Grey Goose has implemented several measures to protect the environment and minimize its carbon footprint. The brand focuses on using natural French ingredients, specifically Picardie soft winter wheat and natural spring water from Gensac-la-Pallue, France, ensuring that every grain of wheat is 100% free of GMOs. France's strict regulations against GMO-grown wheat and the SAI certification of Grey Goose's wheat highlight the brand's commitment to sustainable agricultural practices, including no irrigation and crop rotation for soil regeneration. Additionally, the sourcing of ingredients from a small area in France, close to the distillery, significantly reduces transportation emissions.</p>
<p>Grey Goose also emphasizes the importance of water conservation and purity. The brand's spring water is drawn from a well located above a natural, underground aquifer, protected by an EU Conservation Order. This ensures the water is naturally filtered by limestone, removing pollutants without the need for artificial purification processes.</p>
<p>The brand's commitment to the circular economy is evident in its waste management practices. Grey Goose utilizes wheat by-products for eco-pasture and repurposes leftover wheat products from milling for animal nutrition, demonstrating a no-waste approach. Furthermore, the iconic Grey Goose bottle has been designed with sustainability in mind, featuring a dimple in the base to reduce its overall weight by approximately a fifth, which contributes to reducing the environmental impact of packaging.</p>

<h1>Worker welfare</h1>
<p>Grey Goose collaborates closely with three farming cooperatives in France, ensuring that every grain of wheat is grown and harvested by small, local farmers within 30 miles of the distillery. This partnership not only supports small businesses but also ensures that the farmers who are integral to Grey Goose's production process are partners in the storage, milling, and distilling facilities. This model promotes a seamless operation from sowing to delivery and ensures that the farmers have a stake in the product's success. By working with cooperatives, Grey Goose helps protect small farmers and their crops, fostering a community that thrives together and supports one another.</p>

<p>British Airways is actively working towards reducing its environmental impact through a series of initiatives aimed at achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The airline has committed to improving operational efficiency, investing in more fuel-efficient aircraft, and progressively introducing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) using waste feedstocks. In the medium to long term, British Airways is focusing on the development and scale-up of SAF and exploring new technologies such as zero emissions hydrogen-powered aircraft and carbon capture technology. The airline is flying more fuel-efficient aircraft, including A350s, 787s, A320, and A321neos, which are up to 40% more fuel-efficient than the aircraft they replace. British Airways is also investing in first-of-a-kind SAF plants in the UK and the US to increase the availability of SAF. Additionally, the airline has collaborated with bp to source enough SAF for all its flights between London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh during the UK’s COP26 climate change summit, significantly reducing lifecycle emissions. British Airways is also offsetting carbon emissions on all its flights within the UK and has introduced an online platform, CO2llaborate, allowing customers to purchase SAF or carbon removal credits directly from their seats while onboard. The airline has introduced initiatives to improve sustainability in the air and on the ground, such as switching from diesel to renewably powered electric pushback vehicles and making its inflight magazine and flight manuals digital. British Airways has partnered with the Woodland Trust and Print Releaf to replant its paper footprint generated in the production of onboard paper products.</p>

Beyond packaging, Jameson has repurposed approximately 302,000 unused plastic cups from its inventory to create tote bags, combining 65% PET from these cups with 35% cotton, as part of moving away from single-use plastics in line with Pernod Ricard's sustainability goals.</p>
<p>Irish Distillers announced a significant step towards sustainability by committing to make all secondary packaging across its portfolio of Irish whiskeys recyclable, reusable, compostable, or removed by the end of 2025. This initiative includes the progressive removal of approximately 4 million gift boxes from the Jameson product range. The company is also applying Pernod Ricard’s circular making strategy, which encompasses the principles of Rethink, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Respect, to its product lifecycle. Notable changes include the transition of Midleton Very Rare 2023 to a high-quality recyclable box, reducing fossil fuel emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, and water usage significantly compared to its previous wooden packaging. Jameson 18 Years and other premium offerings like Redbreast 21 and Redbreast 27 will also transition to fully recyclable secondary packaging by the end of 2025.</p>

<p>Winn-Dixie, through its parent company Southeastern Grocers Inc. (SEG), has demonstrated a strong commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainability. In 2022, SEG made significant strides in fulfilling its environmental commitments and implementing sustainable improvements. This includes a focus on increasing sustainability for its Own Brand packaging by the end of 2028, with efforts to eliminate the use of polystyrene and ensure all packaging is either reusable, recyclable, or industrially compostable. Additionally, SEG aims to include an average of 30% post-consumer recycled material in all Own Brand packaging. The company has also committed to the guiding principles of The Five Freedoms of Animal Welfare to enhance its animal welfare policy and outlined policies to protect vital pollinator populations. Furthermore, SEG has partnered with Relocalize to pilot ice manufacturing in the world’s first autonomous micro-factory, designed to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, water waste, and plastic pollution. This initiative launched in March 2023 with the introduction of SE Grocers Party Cubes, a super-premium cubed ice made efficiently, locally, and on-demand for select Jacksonville locations. In celebration of Earth Day, SEG supported environmental causes and promoted sustainability through various actions, including donations to local organizations, partnering with Florida State Parks for design contests aimed at reducing single-use plastic bags, and implementing volunteer cleanup days for store teams.</p>

<p>Aéropostale has taken significant steps to reduce its carbon footprint and protect the environment through the use of recycled materials in its clothing lines. The company has expanded its use of recycled cotton and recycled polyester fabrics, which are made from a mix of pre- and post-consumer waste. This initiative not only reduces air and water pollution but also decreases carbon emissions by avoiding the need for new petroleum in the production of recycled polyester. Additionally, the production of recycled polyester and recycled cotton requires far fewer resources than conventional materials, conserving water and energy. Aéropostale also repurposes materials to prolong their lifespan and prevent them from ending up in landfills prematurely. Their responsible denim collection is manufactured with Repreve® recycled polyester yarns made from plastic bottles, further reducing waste in landfills and conserving water and energy. Moreover, the company uses organically grown cotton, produced without harmful chemicals and in accordance with certified organic agriculture standards, which promotes water and air quality, energy conservation, agricultural biodiversity, and healthy soil. This approach has a lower environmental impact than traditional cotton-growing methods and benefits the long-term health of people and the planet.</p>

<p>Stanley is actively engaged in several initiatives aimed at protecting the environment. The company has made a commitment to prioritize recycled and upcycled materials in their manufacturing processes. Specifically, Stanley has set a goal to ensure that at least 50% of its stainless steel products are made from recycled materials by 2025. This initiative is part of their broader effort to create products that are durable and functional, reducing the need for disposable alternatives. Additionally, Stanley has taken significant steps to reduce its packaging waste. The company has eliminated most conventional plastic packaging and is working towards ensuring all paper packaging is made from certified sustainable or recycled content by the same year, 2025. In a notable effort to reduce plastic waste, Stanley stopped using conventional plastic bags for product shipping and delivery in 2021, opting instead for paper wraps. This change alone is expected to prevent more than 77 metric tons of plastic from being used each year. Furthermore, Stanley's product designs increasingly incorporate recycled materials, such as the use of ocean-bound recycled plastic in the lid of their Iceflow™ Flip Straw Jug, and their Classic Perfect-Brew Pour Over, which eliminates the need for non-organic waste by foregoing filters.</p>

<p>Heath Ceramics has implemented several initiatives to protect the environment, focusing on waste reduction, energy and carbon emissions management, water conservation, and sustainable shipping and purchasing practices. The company has significantly reduced landfill waste by finding innovative end-uses for various waste streams, such as donating production overrun mixed tile boxes to arts non-profit organizations, recycling nitrile plastic gloves into plastic furniture, recycling fired clay waste into raw material for concrete, and composting unusable clay. In the fiscal year 2023, Heath recycled over 200,000 gloves and achieved an 86% waste diversion rate from the landfill.</p>
<p>Heath uses 100% renewable electricity in its factories, sourced from solar and wind, and has converted over 350 fixtures to LED light bulbs to reduce energy consumption. The company's kilns are heated using natural gas, and its clay body is designed to be fired at a lower temperature than typical ceramic tableware and tile products, reducing energy usage. Heath tracks its carbon footprint across scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, with scope 3 emissions accounting for about half of its total carbon footprint due to its comprehensive manufacturing process.</p>
<p>Water conservation efforts include the installation of water recycling systems at its Sausalito and San Francisco factories, which collect water from manufacturing for reuse. As of the fiscal year 2023, 55% of Heath's annual water intake is from internally recycled water. Additionally, the San Francisco Tile Factory and Retail Showroom feature permeable pavers and planter beds made from recycled Heath Tile and Dinnerware to divert water into the watershed rather than the drainage system.</p>
<p>For shipping, Heath uses ExpandOS™, a biodegradable and recyclable paperboard pyramid, to replace foam packing peanuts and stabilize products. Dinnerware and Heath Home shipments are sent using UPS carbon-neutral shipping. The company also prioritizes sustainable purchasing practices, sourcing nearly half of its clay minerals locally and phasing out white clay from its formula to reduce the clay material footprint by 54%.</p>

Employees also receive a minimum of eleven paid time-off days, nine paid holidays, and a paid volunteer day.</p>
<p>In 2016, Heath introduced the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, giving employees partial ownership of the company and increased retirement benefits through stock ownership. The company also focuses on workplace health and safety by providing weekly, in-person, onsite ergonomics training sessions and ergonomic assessments and equipment as needed.</p>
<p>Heath supports a diverse workforce by offering translation services, meetings in Spanish, and human resources personnel who can translate. The company reimburses employees for necessary work-related items, such as boots, headphones, and home office furniture.</p>

<p>Perdue Farms has demonstrated a strong commitment to environmental stewardship through various initiatives aimed at reducing their carbon footprint, conserving natural resources, and promoting sustainability. They have installed solar panels at their LEED® Platinum-certified corporate offices and a feed mill, which is surrounded by a pollinator habitat, showcasing their dedication to renewable energy and biodiversity. The company has also engaged in significant recycling efforts, diverting over 70 million pounds of nitrogen and 46 million pounds of phosphorus from poultry litter out of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Their methane extraction project in Cromwell, Kentucky, which converts methane from an anaerobic lagoon into electricity, has reduced CO2 emissions by approximately 100,000 tons. Additionally, Perdue's Project Clean Stream has removed over half a million pounds of trash from various waterways, and their support for oyster recovery in the Chesapeake Bay has contributed to the planting of nearly 25 million young oysters. These efforts are part of Perdue's broader environmental goals, which include aggressive reductions in greenhouse gases, water use, and solid waste by 2022, with a commitment to transparent reporting on their progress. Furthermore, their partnership with GreenGasUSA aims to further reduce carbon emissions by capturing and converting methane to renewable natural gas (RNG), which has already resulted in a 17% reduction in companywide carbon emissions. Perdue's collaboration with Bayer and ZeaKal focuses on reducing carbon emissions and increasing sustainability in the food value chain through regenerative farming practices and improved soy genetics, respectively. Lastly, their Indiana turkey facility has achieved GreenCircle Zero Waste to Landfill certification, marking a significant milestone in waste diversion and minimization efforts.</p>
