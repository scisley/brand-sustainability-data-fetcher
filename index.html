<p>Taco Bell has implemented several initiatives to protect the environment and reduce its carbon footprint. The company transitioned all of its cold beverage cups and lids in U.S. restaurants to recyclable polypropylene, eliminating polystyrene and reducing resin usage. This change is part of Taco Bell's broader commitment to reducing landfill waste and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, Taco Bell has joined the NextGen Cup Consortium to support the development of recyclable hot cups. In terms of sustainable sourcing, Taco Bell uses palm oil in its Cinnabon DelightsÂ® that is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), aiming to minimize the negative impact of palm oil production on the environment and communities. The company has also made strides in sustainable packaging, with paper bags made from 100% recyclable and sustainably sourced materials and a switch from polystyrene foam to polypropylene for side containers. Taco Bell has set goals for 2025 to make all customer-facing packaging recyclable, compostable, or reusable, remove PFAS, Phthalates, and BPA from all customer-facing packaging, and add recycling and/or composting bins to all restaurants where infrastructure permits.</p>
<p>In a significant move to improve the environmental effects of its supply chain, Taco Bell has partnered with Cargill and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) to implement conservation and regenerative agriculture practices across cattle grazing lands. This $2 million partnership aims to conserve natural resources and reduce the climate impact of beef, one of Taco Bell's top-selling ingredients. The partnership will support beef producers with technical and financial tools to expand regenerative ranching practices, expected to sequester up to 44,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2030.</p>

Paramount utilizes the Green Production Guide (GPG), a set of best practices developed by the Producers Guild of America, to mitigate environmental impacts such as energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste. This guide has been effectively used in domestic productions like âSpecial Ops: Lionessâ and âLawmen: Bass Reeves.â</p>
<p>Internationally, Paramount's efforts have been recognized as well. In the UK, Paramount earned sustainable production certification for 145 projects in 2022, including 50% of projects produced for Channel 5, through the Albert sustainable production initiative. In Australia, Paramount Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) has become a foundational member and seed funder of Sustainable Screens Australia, working towards capturing production-related environmental data.</p>
<p>One notable example of Paramount's commitment to sustainability is the production of <em>Mission: Impossible â Dead Reckoning Part One</em>, which implemented green production practices such as digital paperwork, reusable water bottles, energy-efficient lighting, and recycling of set materials. This production, among others, received Green or Gold Seal recognition from the Environmental Media Association (EMA) for sustainable production practices.</p>

<p>Allstate is actively engaged in efforts to protect the environment and combat climate change. The company has committed to achieving net zero emissions for its business operations and value chain by 2030, a goal that significantly precedes the timeline set by the Paris climate accords. To support this commitment, Allstate has undertaken several initiatives, including increasing biodiversity through the protection and enhancement of native wildlife at a 1,600-acre almond orchard in California. This effort has led to the creation of an ecosystem that regulates water, absorbs carbon dioxide, and promotes biodiversity. Additionally, Allstate is reducing the emissions and square footage of its offices, investing in renewable energy, and partnering with suppliers to reduce their emissions. The company has also transitioned to a hybrid and remote workforce, which has resulted in a reduction of verified emissions by 45% between 2015 and 2021. Furthermore, Allstate's investments in sustainable agriculture and timberlands in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States contribute to increased biodiversity and carbon sequestration. These efforts are part of Allstate's holistic approach to carbon reduction and its commitment to making responsible choices to prepare for and mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>PlayStation, a brand under Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), has implemented several initiatives to reduce its environmental impact. These efforts are part of Sony Group's "Road to Zero" global environmental plan, aiming for a zero environmental footprint by 2050. PlayStation has committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2040. To reduce the power consumption of its consoles, PlayStation has incorporated energy-efficient technologies such as System-on-a-Chip (SoC), die shrink, power scaling, efficient power supplies, and energy-saving rest modes. The PlayStation 5 (PS5) includes new energy-efficient technology that is estimated to avoid approximately 45,600 tonnes of CO2 per year for every million consoles sold. This includes a new efficient USB charging mode and a 7 nm chipset. PlayStation has also made strides in reducing the carbon impact of its products and services by avoiding an estimated 19.5 million tonnes of carbon equivalent emissions globally since the launch of the PS4 in November 2013, with a goal of reaching 27 million by 2030. Additionally, PlayStation is a founding member of the Playing for the Planet Alliance (P4P), which focuses on addressing climate change, restoration of ecosystems, and plastics reduction. Through this alliance, PlayStation has committed to various initiatives, including the development of a carbon footprint tool for P4P members to estimate and manage their own life-cycle carbon emissions. PlayStation's packaging for the PS5 is between 93-99% plastic-free by weight, contributing to its efforts to reduce plastic use.</p>

<p>Xbox, a division of Microsoft, is actively working to reduce its environmental impact as part of Microsoft's broader goal to be carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030. Xbox is innovating in hardware and software design to optimize for renewable energy usage and minimize carbon emissions. This includes making Xbox consoles carbon aware, where game, app, and OS updates are scheduled at times when the local energy grid is using more renewable energy sources, thus reducing dependency on fossil fuels and CO2 emissions. Xbox has also introduced energy-saving settings for its consoles, such as the Shutdown (energy saving) power option, which significantly reduces power consumption when the console is off. Additionally, Xbox is exploring ways to use less new plastic and aims for all Microsoft product packaging to be 100% recyclable by 2030, with a commitment to eliminate single-use plastics in product packaging by 2025. The company has already made strides by converting Xbox gift cards from plastic to paperboard, reducing over 500,000 kg of plastic annually. Furthermore, Xbox offers refurbished consoles as a lower waste alternative to buying new, contributing to the circularity of its products.</p>

<p>Hamburger Helper has taken a significant step towards environmental sustainability by modifying the packaging of its product. By slightly straightening the noodles within their boxes, Hamburger Helper has been able to lay the product flatter, reducing the amount of air in each box. This adjustment has led to a reduction in the size of the boxes, saving nearly 900,000 pounds of paper fiber annually. This change not only results in a decrease in the use of packaging materials but also contributes to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 11 percent. This is equivalent to removing 500 trucks from the road. Additionally, the more compact packaging allows for a 20 percent increase in the number of products that can be stocked on shelves, enhancing efficiency and reducing waste throughout the supply chain. These efforts demonstrate Hamburger Helper's commitment to driving innovation in packaging and reducing environmental impact.</p>

<p>Corona Light, as part of its sustainability efforts, has taken significant steps towards reducing its environmental impact, particularly in terms of plastic usage. The brand has achieved a net-zero plastic footprint, meaning it recovers and recycles as much or more plastic than it uses globally. This initiative prevents plastic from polluting natural paradises. To accomplish this, Corona has partnered with South Pole, a climate solutions provider, to measure the plastic used in its products and distribution and to calculate the impact of its mitigation activities. One of these activities includes a major investment in Mexico Recicla, a recycling facility in Mexico, allowing Corona to recover more plastic than it uses. Additionally, the brand has removed plastic rings from all of its exported cans and eliminated plastic from its pressure-sensitive labels, reducing its footprint by 50,000 pounds. Since 2017, in collaboration with Corona X Parley, the brand has cleaned up 44,026,625 square meters of beach. Corona also invests in recycling programs in Mexico to recover and recycle plastic before it reaches oceans and waterways. Furthermore, the brand has launched the Plastic Free Challenge, an accelerator program aimed at finding solutions for pressing environmental and social challenges.</p>

<p>Coors Light, under the umbrella of Molson Coors, has made significant strides in environmental sustainability, focusing on packaging, water usage, and climate impact. The company has committed to ensuring that by 2025, all consumer-facing packaging will be 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable, with all plastic packaging comprising at least 30% recycled content. A notable initiative is the replacement of plastic rings with 100% recyclable six-pack rings across Molson Coorsâ North American brands, positioning Coors Light as the largest beer brand in North America to undertake such an initiative. This move is expected to eliminate 1.7 million pounds of plastic from the environment annually, with 400,000 pounds from Coors Light packaging alone.</p>
<p>In terms of water conservation, Coors Light aims to grow barley with 10% less water and brew beer with 22% less water by 2025 compared to 2016 levels. Additionally, the company is working to boost water availability in stressed watersheds and restore 3.5 billion gallons of water. Coors Light is also committed to reducing CO2 emissions by 50% in direct operations and 20% across the value chain by 2025 relative to 2016 levels.</p>
<p>The company has also opened a pop-up plastic-free concept store made from 100% sustainable materials, including brewery scraps, to celebrate its commitment to a plastic-free future. This initiative underscores Coors Light's broader environmental goals and its vision for a world free from single-use plastic.</p>

This is a notable achievement compared to the USDA report that 10% of food in America is lost at the retail level. Trader Joe's is committed to further reducing this percentage and eliminating food waste from their stores.</p>
<p>In 2020, Trader Joe's made significant improvements to the packaging of over 150 products by eliminating excess components, increasing the use of recycled and sustainably sourced materials, and removing non-sustainable materials. Notably, the company removed over 2 million pounds of plastic packaging from its products. Examples of these improvements include replacing the black plastic tray for deli meats with a paper-based tray, switching from plastic clamshells to cardboard boxes for cherry tomatoes, and replacing multi-layer foil envelopes with home compostable clear film for tea packaging. Trader Joe's employs a five-point sustainability framework to guide these improvements, focusing on reducing and removing packaging, sourcing renewable and recycled materials, choosing recyclable packaging, avoiding harmful substances, and educating customers on proper disposal and recycling practices.</p>

<p>BBC America, as part of the BBC Group, is actively engaged in various initiatives to minimize its environmental impact and promote sustainability both on and off the screen. The company is committed to reducing the environmental impact of its programs through the implementation of sustainable production practices. This includes the use of the BAFTA albert Consortium's carbon calculator and certification system, which is mandatory for all TV commissions from January 2022. The albert certification recognizes productions that adopt greener working practices, and BBC America's productions, such as "Winterwatch," have made significant strides in this area by using green hydrogen and intelligent hybrid generator systems to power broadcasts, significantly reducing carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, BBC America is involved in portraying sustainability on-screen to reflect societal shifts towards more sustainable living and to educate audiences about climate change and the transition to Net Zero. This is evident in programming that incorporates themes of sustainability, such as the eco-friendly surf center featured in a special episode of "DIY SOS" and the comprehensive environmental content offered through the "Our Planet Now" initiative.</p>
<p>BBC America also supports the BBC Group's Net Zero strategy, which includes Science Based Targets (SBTs) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to a fully electric vehicle fleet by 2030, and achieving Zero Waste to Landfill. The company is part of the Carbon Disclosure Project's supply chain solution and is developing a greenhouse gas emissions reporting platform in collaboration with Microsoft.</p>

<p>Guinness is actively engaging in environmental protection through its Regenerative Agriculture Pilot, aiming to support the transition towards regenerative agriculture among Irish barley farmers. This initiative focuses on adopting nature-based solutions to produce low carbon barley and improve natural resources like biodiversity and water. The pilot, one of the most ambitious on the island of Ireland, involves working with farmers to define effective regenerative practices tailored to Irish barley production. Key outcomes include improvements in soil health and carbon sequestration, enhanced biodiversity, reduced synthetic fertilizer use, enhanced water quality, and improved farm profitability and farmer livelihoods. The pilot also employs a digital management system for monitoring and coordinating field operations, such as soil testing and yield monitoring. Additionally, Guinness has committed to sourcing 100% of its electricity from renewable generation since September 2020, as part of its broader sustainability efforts aligned with Diageoâs Society 2030: Spirit of Progress plan, which includes achieving net zero carbon emissions across its direct operations and a 50% reduction in scope 3 emissions by 2030.</p>

<p>Dial has implemented several initiatives aimed at protecting the environment and promoting sustainability. Through its partnership with Plastic Bank, Dial is actively involved in preventing plastic waste from entering the oceans. This collaboration enables the collection of plastic waste, which is then transformed into Social PlasticÂ® and used in Dial's refill bottles. Dial's commitment to this cause is projected to prevent over 35 million plastic bottles from entering the ocean in 2023 alone. Additionally, the use of 100% Social PlasticÂ® for Dial Hand Soap refill bottles (excluding the cap) is expected to save over 6.5 million pounds of carbon emissions in 2023 by utilizing post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. This effort not only reduces carbon emissions but also promotes the circular economy by reintegrating recycled materials back into the product lifecycle.</p>
<p>Dial has also launched a partnership with TerraCycle to address the recycling of packaging components that are not accepted through traditional curbside recycling programs. This initiative encourages consumers to participate in recycling efforts, further contributing to Dial's environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, Dial's introduction of Concentrated Refills represents an innovative approach to reducing single-use plastic waste. These refills use 95% less plastic compared to traditional soap bottles and are packaged in 100% paper-based materials, with the packets being recyclable through TerraCycle. This initiative is part of Dial's broader commitment to sustainability and reducing its environmental footprint.</p>

<p>Coors, under its parent company Molson Coors, has made significant strides in environmental sustainability, focusing on packaging, water usage, and climate change. The company has committed to ensuring that by 2025, all consumer-facing packaging will be 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable, with all plastic packaging comprising at least 30% recycled content. A notable initiative is the replacement of plastic rings with 100% recyclable six-pack packaging across Molson Coorsâ North American brands, positioning Coors Light as the largest beer brand in North America to undertake such an initiative. This move is expected to eliminate 1.7 million pounds of plastic from the environment annually, with 400,000 pounds from Coors Light packaging alone.</p>
<p>In terms of water conservation, Coors aims to grow barley with 10% less water and brew beer with 22% less water by 2025 compared to 2016 levels. Additionally, the company is working to boost water availability in stressed watersheds and restore 3.5 billion gallons of water. Coors has also set ambitious goals to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% in direct operations and 20% across its value chain by 2025, relative to 2016 levels.</p>
<p>The company has demonstrated a long-standing commitment to sustainability, highlighted by the introduction of the recyclable aluminum can in 1959 and the nationwide recycling program, Cash for Cans, in the early 1970s. Coors has achieved zero waste to landfill status in all its major Coors Light breweries, with over 99.5% of waste being reused, recycled, or turned into energy. Since 2016, Coors has reduced its carbon footprint in the US by nearly 30%, saving more than 1.6 million metric tons of CO2e, and conserved 1.3 billion gallons of water.</p>

<p>Claritin has initiated the DiversiTree Project in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation, focusing on planting female trees to help reduce pollen levels in the environment. This effort is based on the understanding that female trees do not produce pollen and can help balance the pollen levels by receiving pollen released by male trees. The project began with the establishment of the first female forest in Forest Hill Park, Richmond, Virginia, one of the cities worst affected by allergies in 2022. The initiative aims to restore botanical balance by reducing pollen levels through the strategic planting of female trees, such as Juniper, Red Maple, Aspen, and Gingko. This environmental effort not only addresses the issue of rising pollen levels, which are expected to double by 2040, but also contributes to the broader goal of creating healthier outdoor spaces for the community.</p>

<p>Maybelline has launched the "Conscious Together" program, focusing on creating a more responsible business model with a significant emphasis on environmental protection. The program includes initiatives like "Conscious Packaging," where Maybelline has committed to using recycled materials in their products. Since 2018, they have replaced 600 tons of virgin plastic with recycled plastic. By 2030, Maybelline aims for all its plastic packaging to be made from 100% recycled plastic, with 3.5% of all packaging already meeting this goal in 2022.</p>
<p>In terms of "Conscious Production," Maybelline is transitioning its manufacturing sites to use 100% renewable energy. This shift includes implementing energy efficiency measures such as LED lighting, high-efficiency compressors, LEED certification, and the use of renewable energy sources like solar panels and biomass. The goal is for all owned manufacturing sites to be powered by renewable energy by 2025, with 50% already achieving this in 2022.</p>
<p>The "Conscious Formula" initiative aims to make Maybelline's products less impactful on the planet. By 2030, 95% of Maybelline's ingredients will be bio-based, derived from abundant minerals, or produced through circular processes. As of 2022, 32% of ingredients meet these criteria.</p>
<p>Maybelline is also addressing the challenge of cosmetic waste through its "Conscious Disposal" efforts. The company is investing in the development of makeup recycling technologies and expanding takeback programs globally. In 2022, they collected 50 tons of empty product across seven countries.</p>
<p>Additionally, Maybelline has partnered with The Recycling Partnership to launch the Small Town Access Fund, aiming to improve recycling access for communities with populations under 50,000. This initiative is expected to impact over 49 thousand households by reducing contamination in recycling bins and capturing more than 3,500 tons of recyclables.</p>

<p>Jiffy Lube is actively involved in environmental protection through its vehicle maintenance services and oil recycling programs. The company emphasizes the importance of vehicle maintenance in reducing environmental impact. Properly maintained vehicles, including clean filters and lubricants, properly inflated tires, and correct engine tuning, contribute to better fuel efficiency and lower emissions. Jiffy Lube offers services such as setting the right tire pressures, servicing and replacing air and oil filters, and ensuring the engine and drivetrain components are well-lubricated to minimize fuel-robbing friction. Additionally, Jiffy Lube plays a significant role in oil recycling. Some Jiffy Lube locations serve as designated oil recycling collection centers, collecting used motor oil from changes performed at their locations and from individuals who change their oil themselves. This used oil is then sent to an oil-recycling center where it is re-refined and used to make heating oil, asphalt, and other petroleum-based products, significantly reducing waste and environmental impact. The company highlights the importance of recycling motor oil, noting that improper disposal of motor oil can release a substantial amount of oil into the environment, whereas recycling just two gallons of used oil can generate enough electricity to run the average household for almost 24 hours.</p>

<p>Dove Chocolate is actively working towards a deforestation-free supply chain for the cocoa it sources, with a commitment to achieve this goal by 2025. In 2020, Dove Chocolate, through its suppliers, distributed nearly 3.5 million cocoa seedlings to farmers in West Africa. This initiative is part of their broader effort to increase shade and biodiversity in cocoa farming areas, which also saw the distribution of approximately 1.2 million non-cocoa trees. These efforts are aimed at helping cocoa farmers work more efficiently and responsibly, growing more cocoa on less land to preserve forests and increase farmers' incomes. Dove Chocolate's Dark products, including Dove Dark Chocolate, Dove Dark Almond Promises, and Dove Dark Peanut Butter Promises, are sourced from Rainforest Alliance Certified farms. This certification ensures that the cocoa is grown in a way that is better for the environment and the farming communities. Dove Chocolate uses farm mapping to prevent sourcing cocoa from forest lands, National Parks and Reserves, and Classified Forests, contributing to their ambition of a deforestation-free cocoa supply chain.</p>

<p>Dove Chocolate, in partnership with CARE, has been working since 2016 to empower women in its cocoa-supply chain through the Village Savings and Loans model. This initiative aims to support women's empowerment in cocoa-growing communities. On International Womenâs Day in 2019, Dove Chocolate and CARE laid the first stone on a new marketplace for women-led businesses in the village of Gueyo, CÃ´te dâIvoire. This marketplace, which houses 150 businesses primarily run by women, provides modern facilities that protect the vendors and their products from the elements, thereby improving their working conditions and livelihoods. This effort is part of Dove Chocolate's broader mission to improve lives in cocoa-growing communities by ensuring human rights are respected, the environment is protected, and cocoa farmers have the opportunity to thrive.</p>

<p>Greyhound has implemented several measures to reduce its environmental impact and promote sustainable travel. The company highlights that traveling by bus has the lowest carbon footprint compared to other modes of transport, excluding walking and biking. Specifically, choosing Greyhound over personal vehicles can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 79%, and opting for bus travel instead of flying can cut emissions by 84%. Greyhound's fleet includes modern vehicles designed with emissions-reducing components. These buses meet the latest EPA standards for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions and utilize clean-burning low-sulfur, Bio, or Renewable diesel fuel. Since 2008, all buses have been equipped with diesel particulate filters, and since 2014, new buses feature DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) after-treatment systems to further reduce emissions. Additionally, Greyhound has implemented idle management systems to conserve fuel and minimize emissions when buses are not moving. The company also focuses on eco-friendly practices in its stations, such as switching to LED lighting, employing environmentally-friendly landscaping that requires minimal watering, and recycling cooking oil used in food services. These efforts collectively contribute to Greyhound's commitment to environmental protection and sustainable travel.</p>

<p>While Long John Silver's does not explicitly mention animal welfare certifications or specific animal welfare programs, their commitment to responsibly sourcing seafood indirectly suggests an awareness of the impact of their operations on marine life. The company's focus on sourcing from "real sea-places" and working with partners who aim to fish smarter with less environmental impact hints at a consideration for the health and sustainability of marine populations. However, without explicit details on animal welfare standards or certifications, it's difficult to assess the extent of their commitment to minimizing animal suffering.</p>

<p>Jaguar, under its parent company Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), is actively working towards environmental sustainability through various initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting the use of renewable energy. The company has committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions across its supply chain, products, and operations by 2039. This ambitious goal is part of JLR's Reimagine strategy, which includes the electrification of both the Jaguar and Land Rover brands. By the end of the decade, all Jaguar and Land Rover nameplates will be available in pure electric form. Jaguar is set to become an all-electric luxury brand from 2025, and Land Rover will introduce six pure electric variants in the next five years, with the first all-electric model expected in 2024.</p>
<p>JLR has also focused on sustainable operations by paying attention to the facilities that manufacture its vehicles. The Advanced Product Centre in Gaydon, UK, has been extended and redeveloped to include over 11 hectares of new landscaping, increasing the site's natural habitat by 25% and incorporating a 3,000m2 rooftop solar array. The company has successfully reduced its global vehicle manufacturing operating CO2 by 46% per vehicle and remains committed to further decarbonization.</p>
<p>In addition to vehicle electrification and sustainable operations, JLR is pioneering in the use of recycled materials and the development of circular economy principles. The company is actively recycling and reusing waste and materials, developing second lives for electric vehicle batteries, removing single-use plastic items from its operations, and recovering and reforming aluminum from used vehicles for new models. This approach not only reduces the need for virgin materials but also significantly lowers energy consumption in the production of recycled aluminum compared to new aluminum.</p>

<p>Splenda has initiated a significant step towards environmental sustainability with the establishment of the first-ever fully integrated, United States-based stevia farm in Central Florida. This initiative is aimed at producing superior tasting stevia sweetener while fostering the growth of an emerging US agriculture industry. A key aspect of this endeavor is the reduction of environmental impact, particularly by eliminating unnecessary CO2 emissions that are typically associated with the global stevia supply chain. The farm's design and operations emphasize eco-conscious practices, including socially responsible farming techniques, water conservation measures, and effective waste management. These efforts are geared towards minimizing the environmental footprint of stevia processing. Additionally, the farm's vertical integration allows for comprehensive oversight of stevia production, from crop propagation to extraction, ensuring sustainability throughout the process. The innovative approach to stevia cultivation and processing not only aims to provide high-quality, great-tasting low-calorie sweeteners but also promotes a circle of sustainability by repurposing the clean stevia leaves as nutrient-rich feed in animal agriculture, thereby avoiding waste creation. This initiative reflects Splenda's commitment to environmental stewardship and its goal to contribute to a more sustainable agriculture industry in the US. </p>

<p>Virgin Mobile Middle East and Africa (MEA) has taken significant steps towards environmental protection by achieving net-zero carbon emissions across all its operations in 2021. This milestone was reached through a partnership with the Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence, which involved gathering and assessing data to calculate the group-wide total emissions and implementing sustainable processes for the reduction of overall emissions. Virgin Mobile MEA has eliminated over 50 tonnes of single-use plastic by removing it from its SIM packs and recharge cards. Additionally, the company has reduced the size of its SIM cards and switched to recycled paper for SIM card packaging, achieving 100% single-use plastic-free operations in Oman and Saudi Arabia. Sustainable practices have also been introduced in its offices, focusing on business travel, reduce and reuse policies, energy efficiency, and sustainability awareness and education. To offset its emissions annually and reach net-zero carbon emissions, Virgin Mobile MEA has invested in nature-based solutions. The company plans to plant thousands of trees in school locations through Carbon Footprint Ltd to support local wildlife habitats and educate children on the importance of natural ecosystems. Furthermore, Virgin Mobile MEA enables customers to offset their carbon footprint with any purchases made through the Virgin Mobile app, as part of its mission to achieve a carbon-negative footprint.</p>

This protocol has led to the certification of 70 olive oil mills and nearly 680,000 acres of olive groves across Italy, Spain, Tunisia, and Argentina, propelling over 40,000 farmers into a new era of sustainable olive farming. Additionally, Bertolli Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil has been launched in the U.S. in 100 percent recycled plastic bottles, marking a significant step towards reducing plastic consumption. The company is also working on optimizing the weight of its plastic packaging by up to 10 percent, which is expected to result in a global reduction of approximately 110 tons of plastic annually. Furthermore, Deoleo is making strides in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through investments in energy-efficient and low-carbon technologies, alongside conducting energy consumption audits and viability studies. Its Tavernelle and Alcolea plants have been recognized as "Zero waste plants" by PreZero, an international waste and recycling management leader, and the Alcolea plant is set to receive photovoltaic panels to generate clean energy, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>

<p>Grey Goose has implemented several measures to protect the environment and minimize its carbon footprint. The brand focuses on using natural French ingredients, specifically Picardie soft winter wheat and natural spring water from Gensac-la-Pallue, France, ensuring that every grain of wheat is 100% free of GMOs. France's strict regulations against GMO-grown wheat and the SAI certification of Grey Goose's wheat highlight the brand's commitment to sustainable agricultural practices, including no irrigation and crop rotation for soil regeneration. Additionally, the sourcing of ingredients from a small area in France, close to the distillery, significantly reduces transportation emissions.</p>
<p>Grey Goose also emphasizes the importance of water conservation and purity. The brand's spring water is drawn from a well located above a natural, underground aquifer, protected by an EU Conservation Order. This ensures the water is naturally filtered by limestone, removing pollutants without the need for artificial purification processes.</p>
<p>The brand's commitment to the circular economy is evident in its waste management practices. Grey Goose utilizes wheat by-products for eco-pasture and repurposes leftover wheat products from milling for animal nutrition, demonstrating a no-waste approach. Furthermore, the iconic Grey Goose bottle has been designed with sustainability in mind, featuring a dimple in the base to reduce its overall weight by approximately a fifth, which contributes to reducing the environmental impact of packaging.</p>

<p>Grey Goose collaborates closely with three farming cooperatives in France, ensuring that every grain of wheat is grown and harvested by small, local farmers within 30 miles of the distillery. This partnership not only supports small businesses but also ensures that the farmers who are integral to Grey Goose's production process are partners in the storage, milling, and distilling facilities. This model promotes a seamless operation from sowing to delivery and ensures that the farmers have a stake in the product's success. By working with cooperatives, Grey Goose helps protect small farmers and their crops, fostering a community that thrives together and supports one another.</p>

Additionally, Jameson has made efforts to ensure that its 500ml plastic bottles and aluminum cans are recyclable, aligning with global recycling standards. The company has also taken steps to make its cardboard gift boxes 100% recyclable by removing all plastic inserts, facilitating easier recycling processes for consumers. Beyond packaging, Jameson has repurposed approximately 302,000 unused plastic cups from its inventory to create tote bags, combining 65% PET from these cups with 35% cotton, as part of moving away from single-use plastics in line with Pernod Ricard's sustainability goals.</p>
<p>Irish Distillers announced a significant step towards sustainability by committing to make all secondary packaging across its portfolio of Irish whiskeys recyclable, reusable, compostable, or removed by the end of 2025. This initiative includes the progressive removal of approximately 4 million gift boxes from the Jameson product range. The company is also applying Pernod Ricardâs circular making strategy, which encompasses the principles of Rethink, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Respect, to its product lifecycle. Notable changes include the transition of Midleton Very Rare 2023 to a high-quality recyclable box, reducing fossil fuel emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, and water usage significantly compared to its previous wooden packaging. Jameson 18 Years and other premium offerings like Redbreast 21 and Redbreast 27 will also transition to fully recyclable secondary packaging by the end of 2025.</p>

<p>AÃ©ropostale has taken significant steps to reduce its carbon footprint and protect the environment through the use of recycled materials in its clothing lines. The company has expanded its use of recycled cotton and recycled polyester fabrics, which are made from a mix of pre- and post-consumer waste. This initiative not only reduces air and water pollution but also decreases carbon emissions by avoiding the need for new petroleum in the production of recycled polyester. Additionally, the production of recycled polyester and recycled cotton requires far fewer resources than conventional materials, conserving water and energy. AÃ©ropostale also repurposes materials to prolong their lifespan and prevent them from ending up in landfills prematurely. Their responsible denim collection is manufactured with RepreveÂ® recycled polyester yarns made from plastic bottles, further reducing waste in landfills and conserving water and energy. Moreover, the company uses organically grown cotton, produced without harmful chemicals and in accordance with certified organic agriculture standards, which promotes water and air quality, energy conservation, agricultural biodiversity, and healthy soil. This approach has a lower environmental impact than traditional cotton-growing methods and benefits the long-term health of people and the planet.</p>

<p>Bud Light Platinum, under its parent company Anheuser-Busch, has taken significant steps towards environmental sustainability. The brand achieved Climate Neutral Certification by measuring, offsetting last year's carbon emissions, and implementing plans to reduce future emissions. This certification, awarded by the nonprofit organization Climate Neutral, indicates that Bud Light Platinum has taken accountability for the greenhouse gas emissions generated in the production and operations of their goods or services. To further demonstrate their commitment to environmental protection, Bud Light Platinum has decided to feature the Climate Neutral certification on its packaging. Additionally, in collaboration with the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS), Bud Light Platinum offset 100% of the electricity used during the LCS Spring Finals in Houston, TX, with clean, renewable wind power sources. These actions are part of Bud Light's broader efforts to encourage environmental responsibility among consumers and partners, including joining the How2RecycleÂ® labeling program and conducting a zero-emissions beer delivery with Nikola Corporation and BYD Motors ahead of Super Bowl 56. These initiatives underscore Bud Light Platinum's commitment to becoming Anheuser-Buschâs first net-zero carbon footprint beer, aligning with the company's ambition to achieve net zero by 2040 through sustainability initiatives.</p>

<p>Johnsonville Sausage has initiated several measures to reduce its environmental impact, particularly in its packaging processes. The company has transitioned to using an innovative polystyrene foam tray, named EVOKÂ®, for its fresh sausage products. This tray is notable for containing 25% recycled material, making Johnsonville the first national branded sausage leader to adopt this packaging in the U.S. The switch to EVOKÂ® packaging is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% across all its fresh meats, including a wide range of products from Fresh Bratwurst to Chicken Kabobs. Additionally, Johnsonville has implemented other environmental initiatives, such as a recycle and reuse program with its zipper spool vendor, which has prevented 50,000 pounds of waste from reaching landfills. The company also redesigned some of its polystyrene foam trays to use 6% less packaging material, resulting in an annual reduction of 120,000 pounds of material waste. These efforts are part of Johnsonville's broader commitment to reduce, reuse, and recycle, aiming to minimize its environmental footprint.</p>

<p>Heath Ceramics has implemented several initiatives to protect the environment, focusing on waste reduction, energy and carbon emissions management, water conservation, and sustainable shipping and purchasing practices. The company has significantly reduced landfill waste by finding innovative end-uses for various waste streams, such as donating production overrun mixed tile boxes to arts non-profit organizations, recycling nitrile plastic gloves into plastic furniture, recycling fired clay waste into raw material for concrete, and composting unusable clay. In the fiscal year 2023, Heath recycled over 200,000 gloves and achieved an 86% waste diversion rate from the landfill.</p>
<p>Heath uses 100% renewable electricity in its factories, sourced from solar and wind, and has converted over 350 fixtures to LED light bulbs to reduce energy consumption. The company's kilns are heated using natural gas, and its clay body is designed to be fired at a lower temperature than typical ceramic tableware and tile products, reducing energy usage. Heath tracks its carbon footprint across scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, with scope 3 emissions accounting for about half of its total carbon footprint due to its comprehensive manufacturing process.</p>
<p>Water conservation efforts include the installation of water recycling systems at its Sausalito and San Francisco factories, which collect water from manufacturing for reuse. As of the fiscal year 2023, 55% of Heath's annual water intake is from internally recycled water. Additionally, the San Francisco Tile Factory and Retail Showroom feature permeable pavers and planter beds made from recycled Heath Tile and Dinnerware to divert water into the watershed rather than the drainage system.</p>
<p>For shipping, Heath uses ExpandOSâ¢, a biodegradable and recyclable paperboard pyramid, to replace foam packing peanuts and stabilize products. Dinnerware and Heath Home shipments are sent using UPS carbon-neutral shipping. The company also prioritizes sustainable purchasing practices, sourcing nearly half of its clay minerals locally and phasing out white clay from its formula to reduce the clay material footprint by 54%.</p>

Employees also receive a minimum of eleven paid time-off days, nine paid holidays, and a paid volunteer day.</p>
<p>In 2016, Heath introduced the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, giving employees partial ownership of the company and increased retirement benefits through stock ownership. The company also focuses on workplace health and safety by providing weekly, in-person, onsite ergonomics training sessions and ergonomic assessments and equipment as needed.</p>
<p>Heath supports a diverse workforce by offering translation services, meetings in Spanish, and human resources personnel who can translate. The company reimburses employees for necessary work-related items, such as boots, headphones, and home office furniture.</p>
